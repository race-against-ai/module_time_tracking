The checkpoints are created by clicking on booth sides of the track where the checkpoint shall be. The First checkpoint 
that is set will also be the finish line.The checkpoint will be visualized by a white line. To delete that checkpoint 
the user can click the left mouse button. To delete all checkpoints he can click the middle mouse button. After all 
Checkpoints are set, press "q" to close this window and start the module. With the start of the module a debug window 
opens in that you can see the checkpoints in red and the vehicle tracking in white.
